# Plasma-Antenna-Design-Simulation
My project focuses on comparing metal antennas with plasma antennas, analyzing key parameters such as gain, S11, far-field patterns, and overall performance.
## I have completed an internship report on plasma antenna design and simulation, which involves reproducing multiple research papers to analyze and compare antenna performance.
